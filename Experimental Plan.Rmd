## Publically Available RNAseq  

1. The iDEP or TACITuS pipeline for transcriptomic profiling and GSEA/pathway analysis.   
2. The CIBERSORT immune-cell deconvolution algorithm to obtain cell-fractions and gene expression/enrichment scores of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.   
3. The GEPIA2 database for survival analysis correlating to immune infiltration and/or differential gene expression.   



# Ideas

## Rituximab Resistance

### Generate Rituximab Resistant PDX
- Resistance to Rituximab-CDC
- Resistance to Rituximab-ADCC (NK cell dependent)
- Apply barcoding approach to try to identify signalling pathways which are depended on for evasion



## Humanised Mice PDX 

### Incorporate Barcodes?
- This is very undercooked

## Omo-MYC
- Waiting for regualtory approval

## (Shelved) A20 Modelling the BL Tumour Microenviroment

### Overview
- Using A20 to model BL immune TME
  * Look specifically at T-cell infiltration
  * Immune evasion mechanisms deployed by BL 
- Compare results to patient data
- Apply findings to humanised mouse models of BL PDX

#### Issues
- What is the Biological/clinical relevance of this model?
- Are you priming an infiltrating response due to the nature of cell injections causing necrosis (thereby stimulating the immune system)

#### Background
- The impact of immune TME in BL is unclear
- BL 

### Experimental Plan

#### E1: NSG vs BALB/C A20 injection
##### E1 Overview
- Compare between immunocompetent and immunocomprimised mice
- Basic actors to compare
  * Tumour growth rate
  * Tumour size

##### Injection Plan

| Group | Strain  |Location | Cell Injection| Cell Number|
|:--------:|:----:|:----:|:-------:|
| 1 | BALB/c | Sub-cut | A20 | 1x10^6^ |
| 2 |BALB/c  | IP | A20 | 1x10^6^ |
| 3 | NSG  | IP | A20 | 1x10^6^ |
| 4 | NSG  | Sub-cut | A20 | 1x10^6^ |

  
##### IHC Panel
- Compare markers between tumour types
- Burkitt IHC indentification:
  * CD10+ (B-Cell Germinal Centre)
  * Bcl-2-
  * Ki-67%hi (proliferation index)

#### E2: BL Therapies (this will not work)
- Balb/c drug vs no drug vs WS-A20 drug vs WS-A20 no drug
  * Want to compare effect of GFP on immune cell infiltration
  * Look at clonal dynamics of rituximab treatment
- Glo-BNHL Trial
  * Odronextamab
    - CD20xCD3 Bispecific antibody
  * Loncastuximab tesirine
    - 
  * Rituximab
- CAR treatments?
- Bi-Specific antibodies (check that they can be applied to mice)
- Rituximab comparison
  * Clonal dynamics of Rituximab treatment
    - WILDseq


#### E3: Immune focused CRISPR Screen
- Immune compromised vs Immune competent
  * Think very carefully about specific mouse models (some still have macrophages, NK cells, ect.)
  * [JAX Lab Article](https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2006/March/choosing-an-immunodeficient-mouse-model#:~:text=Immunodeficient%20mouse%20models%2C%20particularly%20severe,cell%20biology%20and%20other%20research.)


## Ferritin as a drug delivery system
- Does BL have increased Tfr1 expression relative to normal cells/B cells?
