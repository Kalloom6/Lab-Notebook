# Project 1: A20 Modelling the BL Tumour Microenviroment

## Overview
- Using A20 to model BL immune TME
  * Look specifically at T-cell infiltration
  * Immune evasion mechanisms deployed by BL 
- Compare results to patient data
- Apply findings to humanised mouse models of BL PDX

## Background
- The impact of immune TME in BL is unclear
- BL 

## Experimental Plan

### E1: NSG vs BALB/C A20 injection
#### E1 Overview
- Compare between immunocompetent and immunocomprimised mice
- Basic actors to compare
  * Tumour growth rate
  * Tumour size

#### Injection Plan

| Group | Strain  |Location | Cell Injection| Cell Number|
|:--------:|:----:|:----:|:-------:|
| 1 | BALB/c | Sub-cut | A20 | 1x10^6^ |
| 2 |BALB/c  | IP | A20 | 1x10^6^ |
| 3 | NSG  | IP | A20 | 1x10^6^ |
| 4 | NSG  | Sub-cut | A20 | 1x10^6^ |

  
#### IHC Panel
- Compare markers between tumour types
- Burkitt IHC indentification:
  * CD10+ (B-Cell Germinal Centre)
  * Bcl-2-
  * Ki-67%hi (proliferation index)
  
  Potential IHC Panel Markers
  
| Cell Type | Marker | 
| :-------: | :------: | 
| Proliferation marker | Ki67 |
| B cell | CD20 |
|   T cells (all)   | CD3 |
| T Cells (cytotoxic) | CD8 |
| T cells (helper) | CD 4 |
| Dendritic Cells | CD11c |
| Macrophage | F4/80 |

#### Flow Panel
- Options are:
  * Standard T Cell
  * TRegs
  * B-cells
  * DC Mono CD11c
  * Th17
  * TfH
- Check what Swetha ordered
* Box 7 antibody sheet dropbox
  
 Standard T Cell
  
| Cell Type | Marker | 
| :-------: | :------: | 
| T Memory | CXCR3 |
| Naive Immune Cells | CCR7 |
|   Naive T Cells   | CD45RA |
| Th17 | CCR6 |
| GC B-Cells | CD38 |
| TRegs (Helper) | CD4 |
| Macrophage | HLA-DR |
|  T Cells (all)   | CD3 |
| T Cells (Cytoxic)  | CD8 |

### E2: Trial BL Therapies
- CAR drugs
- Bi-Specific antibodies (check that they can be applied to mice)
- Rituximab comparison
  * Clonal dynamics of Rituximab treatment
    - WILDseq


### E3: Immune focused CRISPR Screen
- Immune compromised vs Immune competent
  * Think very carefully about specific mouse models (some still have macrophages, NK cells, ect.)
  * [JAX Lab Article](https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2006/March/choosing-an-immunodeficient-mouse-model#:~:text=Immunodeficient%20mouse%20models%2C%20particularly%20severe,cell%20biology%20and%20other%20research.)
  


# Project 2: Spatial Transciptomics of BL

11 Samples of BL acquired from VIVO BioBank

Looking at characterizing the Human BL TME
- Publically available BL Data - VISIUM internal samples - Mibiscope Internal Samples

Publically available datasets analysis
- Talk to Jamie again

- 10x Visium transcriptomics
  * T Cell Dynamics
    - Infiltration
    - Exhaustion
  * NK cell dynamics
  * Places to get it done:
    - CI (no)
    - [Source Bioscience](https://sourcebioscience.com/genomics/10x-visium-spatial-transcriptomics/)
    - Wellcome Sanger Institute
      * Teichmann Lab used 10x Visium
  
- MIBIScope Comparison
  * Does Protein expression map onto spatial gene expression?
  * Collaborate with Nina in Germany
