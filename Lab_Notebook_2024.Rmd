- Split: seeded 5x10^6^ cells

## N2-BC4 RTX CDC Assay - version 2
Overview: Trying to optimise RTX CDC assay
- Using 0% serum, since there are no complement factors in the media the cell live/dead reading should not change
- Next step: add varying amounts of human serum

# Friday 22-03-2024

## Cell Culture

### N2-BC4
- Cells look healthy
- Feeders in flask are also healthly
- Split 5x10^6^ back into T175 with 30mL of AR-6

## EC50 RTX N2-BC4 22324 - Seeding
- Seeded 96-well plate with N2-BC4 and treated with RTX concentration range with or with out 10% Human Serum (HS)
  * Used Heat-Inacted Serum which does not have functional complement which is why this experiment did not work
- Plate seeding protocol:
  1. Diluted cell suspension to seed 20000 cells/well in 50$\mu$L amounts
  
| Well Number | Cells total | Volume total | CS cells/mL | Flask cell count | **Flask Volume** | **Media Volume** |
| :-------: | :------: | :--------:|:----------:|:---------:|:----:|:-------:|
| 60 wells | 1.2x10^6^ cells | 3 mL     | 4x10^5^ |3.06x10^6^ | **400$\mu$L** | **2.6 mL** |

  2. Made RTX dilutions and added to respective wells in 50$\mu$L  
    - [RTX stock] = 10.3 mg/mL 
    - Drug volumes are added in triplicate
    - Drug volumes are being added consititute 1/4 of well volume: [RTX working] needs to be 4x [RTX well]  
    - 6 wells per condition, 50$\mu$L per well ~ minimum of 300$\mu$L per condition needed (recommend 500$\mu$L)  
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

excel_data <- read_excel("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofCambridge/Lab Notebook/Data/Drug Dilution Tables/240325_DDT.xlsx")

# Display the data as a table
knitr::kable(excel_data)

```
  
  3. Added 10% serum or media control
  - This provides complement factors to bind BL-bound RTX and initiate CDC
  - Serum/media amounts added at 100 $\mu$L/well
  - Serum volume is added in 1:4 ratio (20$\mu$L serum in 200$\mu$L final well volume)
  - Serum stock mix is 1.2mL HS : 2.4 mL media / plate
  
  4. Plate is incubated for 72 hrs at 37C

## Ramos/N2 CDC Testing  

- Tested CDC assay adapted from [Ge et al., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315025/#CR32)
- CDC protocol
1. Seed 250k cells 500uL volumes per well of a 12-well plate  
2. Added RTX or media in 250uL volumes per well
  * [RTX Stock] = 10mg/mL
  * [RTX] working needs to be 4x final desired well volume
  * 1uL RTX stock added to 1mL Media
3. Add Serum or media in 250uL volumes per well
  * Serum amount should be 4x final % desired

## EC50 RTX RAMOS-DP2 240730 - Seeding
- Seeded an EC50 experiment comparing the effects of RTX on Cx/Rx-DP1 cell lines in the prescense of 25% NHS 
- Seeded 3 plates each with a different RAMOS-DP line 
- Used Rixathon (Catalogue#: )

### Plate seeding protocol:  

  1. Diluted cell suspension to seed 10000 cells/well in 50$\mu$L amounts
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

excel_data <- read_excel("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofCambridge/Lab Notebook/Data/Drug Dilution Tables/240726_DDT_EC50.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet3")

columns_to_format <- c("Cell Line", "Cell Count", "Required Cell total", "CS cells/mL")

excel_data <- apply_scientific_notation(excel_data, columns_to_format)

# Display the data as a table
knitr::kable(excel_data)

```

  2. Made RTX dilutions and added to respective wells in 25$\mu$L    
    - [RTX stock] = 10.3 mg/mL    
    - Drug volumes are added in triplicate  
    - Drug volumes are being added consititute 1/4 of well volume:   
      * [RTX working] needs to be 4x [RTX well]   
    - 6 wells per condition, 25$\mu$L per well ~ minimum of 150$\mu$L per condition needed (recommend 200$\mu$L)
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

excel_data <- read_excel("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofCambridge/Lab Notebook/Data/Drug Dilution Tables/240726_DDT_EC50.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet2")

# Display the data as a table
knitr::kable(excel_data, digits = 1)

```
 
 3. Added HIAS/NHS to indicated wells
  * 25$\mu$L/well
  * Final well volume = 25% Serum (HIAS/NHS)
 4. Plate is incubated for 48 hrs at 37C

  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read_xlsx("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofCambridge/Lab Notebook/Data/Lab Notebook - Table excel files/240726_PM_EC50.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")
title <- "EC50 CDC Test N2 + RAMOS 240730"


P1 <- plate_plot(
  data = df,
  position = well,
  value = Condition,
  label = Value,
 label_size = 2,
  plate_size = 96,
  plate_type = "round",
  #colour = "#2E008B",
  title = title
)

print(P1)

## RAMOS RTX CDC DP2 - CD20 Flow Cytometry
- Checked CD20 expression between Cx and Rx DP2
- CD20:
- Samples tested: 
  * Baseline RAMOS 
  * R1
  * R3 
  * R6
  * C1 
  * C3
  * C6


### CD20 Flow Protocol

- Prior to starting: Make cell stain 
  * 500$\mu$L  PBS + 2$\mu$L Stain
  * 100$\mu$L of stain used/condition
- Cell stain made: 2000 $\mu$L and 8 $\mu$L 

1. Resuspend cells and transferred to 3 wells of a 96 well plate
2. Spun down at 1500g for 2min
3. Flick media out
4. Resuspend w/ 100$\mu$L stain in well and consolidate in 1 well
  * Add 100$\mu$L to bottom well and mix until cells resuspended
  * Take 100$\mu$L CS-stain mix and add to well below and mix
  * Repeat for third well and add the total CS-Stain mix to top well
5. Incubate in fridge for 25min
  * In the dark
6. Spin down at 1500g for 2min
7. Flick out media
8. Resuspend in PBS and add to FACS tube
  * Add an additional volume of PBS to dilute cells appropriately for flow
  * Usually make it up to about 300-400$\mu$L CS-PBS in the tube
  
### Results
- No apparent change in CD20 expression
- This is interesting based on strong evidence which suggests loss of CD20 is the primary mechanism of RTX resistance
- Will need to compare to EC50_240730 results
  * Are Rx-DP2 actually resistant compared to Cx-DP2?

## RAMOS BC 1 - Baseline
- Split 1/6 
- RPMI/10% FBS in T75

## RAMOS BC 1 - Rx/DP2
- Expanded remaining Rx/DP2 into T75
- RPMI/10% FBS in T75

| DP Line | CS Volume | Media Volume|
| :-------: | :------: | :--------:|
| R1-DP2   | 10 mL | 10 mL     |
| R2-DP2    |10 mL | 10 mL    |
| R4-DP2   | 5 mL | 5 mL     |
| R6-DP2    |8 mL | 10 mL    |

## RAMOS RTX DP - Dose 3 Collection
- Decided to collect after 24hrs due to high amount of cell killing 
  * Most examples in the literature do 24hr collection

### Collection Protocol
#### Rx-DP3:

1. Well volume transferred to 15ml Eppendorf
2. Eppendorfs supn down at 200 rcf for 6 min
3. Supernatant discarded and R1-4, R6 resuspended in 1ml
  - R5 resuspended in 500$\mu$L due to small pellet
4. Collected cells added to individual wells of 12-well plate
  - R5 added to 24-well plate
  
#### Cx-DP3

- Good viability for all wells
- Entire CS transferred to individal T75s and topped up with 8mL of RPMI/10% FBS in T75

# Thursday 01-08-2024

## Rx-DP3 Culture
- Cells are growing but lots of dead cells as well
- Added 1mL to all wells
  * 500uL to R5

## Cx-RP3 Culture
- Look healthy but still growing, no split

## EC50_240730 Collection - RAMOS RTX CDC DP2

- Collected plates seeded on 21-07-2024
- EC Plate collection protocol:
  1. Added 20$\mu$L Cell Titre Blue (CTB) to each conditioned well 
    * 20$\mu$L CTB/100$\mu$L of conditioned well recommended by manufacturer
  2. Incubated for 2hr at 37C
  3. Read on plate reader according to Cell Titre Blue Protocol

### Results:
- Less response for Rx-DP2 vs Cx-DP2
- Not sure its fully "resistant", still a robust response to RTX dosing for Rx-DP2
