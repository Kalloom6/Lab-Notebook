6. Elute in 40 $\mu$L of EB  
7. Load the whole of the 40 $\mu$L samples on a 1.5% agarose gel and cut out the band as close as possible to limit the amount of agarose  
8. Weigh gel slice and add 3x volume of QG buffer and incubate at 50C until gel is dissolved  
9. Add 1 volume of Isopropanol, vortex and add to column  
10. Wash with 500 $\mu$l QG  
11. Wash with 750 $\mu$L PE  
- Let stand for 5 min with frequent inversion of the column  
12. Wash 500 $\mu$L PE  
- Let stand for 5 min with frequent inversion of the column  
13. Wash 500 $\mu$L PE  
- Let stand for 10 min with frequent inversion of the column 
14. Transfer column to new Eppendorf with lid cut off and spin at full speed  
15. Transfer column to a new Eppendorf with lid cut-off and let dry with cap open for 5 mins  
16. Elute 30 $\mu$L of EB, incubate for 5mins and then spin through column and collect
