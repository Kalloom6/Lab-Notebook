# Overview 
- We want to generate a RTX resistant cell line of RAMOS
- We want to analyse changes in barcode representation over time and do scRNA-seq of naive and resistant cells

# Inital Testing

-Several papers have used something approximating the protocol below:

1. Seed 1x10^6^ cells/ml in a 6-well plate
  * May want to alter cell amounts
  * Ex. 1 well w/ 1ml of CS, 0.8ml of CS, 0.5ml of CS, ect.
2. Add 1ug/mL of RTX and 10% and 25% NHS
3. Incubate at 37C for 1hr 
4. Check for cell lysis

- Unlikely to exhibit cell lysis, this hasn't been seen in previous attempts, alternatively:

1. Seed 1x10^5^ cells/ml in a 6-well plate
2. Add 1ug/mL of RTX, 10%/25% of NHS
3. Incubate at 37C for 48 hours
  * Check at 24hrs to see if there is noticable change
4. 40-50% viability?
  * Attempt reculture
