# CD20 Flow Protocol

## Overview
- Prior to starting: Make cell stain 
  * 500$\mu$L  PBS + 2$\mu$L Stain
  * 100$\mu$L of stain used/condition

## Protocol
1. Resuspend cells and transferred to 3 wells of a 96 well plate
2. Spun down at 1500g for 2min
3. Flick media out
4. Resuspend w/ 100$\mu$L stain in well and consolidate in 1 well
  * Add 100$\mu$L to bottom well and mix until cells resuspended
  * Take 100$\mu$L CS-stain mix and add to well below and mix
  * Repeat for third well and add the total CS-Stain mix to top well
5. Incubate in fridge for 25min
  * In the dark
6. Spin down at 1500g for 2min
7. Flick out media
8. Resuspend in PBS and add to FACS tube
  * Add an additional volume of PBS to dilute cells appropriately for flow
  * Usually make it up to about 300-400$\mu$L CS-PBS in the tube
